# Detailed Plan for Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2)

## Goals
The primary goal of Sprint 1 is to establish the foundational elements of the Ubongo Junior application. This involves setting up the development environment, defining the core game mechanics, and creating a working prototype of the game's logic.

---

## Tasks and Milestones

### 1. **Development Environment Setup**
- **Tasks:**
  - Install necessary tools: Java Development Kit (JDK), JavaFX libraries, VS Code, Draw.io Extension
  - Set up a [Git repository](https://github.com/Afihu/Baked_Beans_OOP_Java_P2) for version control and collaboration. 
  - Create an initial project structure with placeholders for main components (e.g., `src`, `resources`, and `tests`).
- **Milestone:**
  - A fully configured development environment with a basic project structure committed to the repository.

### 2. **Define Project Structure and Classes**
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify core classes: `Game`, `Board`, `Tile`, `Player`, and `TaskCard`.
  - Draft UML diagrams to illustrate relationships between classes.
  - Implement stubs for the identified classes with placeholder methods and attributes.
- **Milestone:**
  - A clear and documented class structure with initial stubs available in the repository.

### 3. **Basic Game Rules Implementation**
- **Tasks:**
  - Develop logic for task card generation, including randomized patterns.
  - Implement rules for placing tiles on the board (e.g., checking validity of placements).
  - Build a simple command-line interface to test the rules interactively.
- **Milestone:**
  - A functional prototype demonstrating the core game rules and interactions in a console-based format.

### 4. **Timer Mechanism**
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a countdown timer class with customizable duration.
  - Integrate the timer into the prototype to enforce time limits on gameplay.
- **Milestone:**
  - A functioning timer that integrates seamlessly with the game logic.

### 5. **Testing and Validation**
- **Tasks:**
  - Write unit tests for individual components, including task card generation, tile placement logic, and the timer.
  - Conduct integration tests to ensure all components work together as intended.
- **Milestone:**
  - All implemented features pass unit and integration tests.

## Deliverables
- A Git repository with:
  - Configured project structure and initial codebase.
  - Stubs for key classes.
  - A prototype demonstrating game logic in a console environment.
- UML diagrams documenting the class structure.
- Comprehensive unit and integration test reports.

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Delays in setting up the development environment.
  - **Mitigation:** Allocate extra time for troubleshooting and ensure all team members have access to required tools and resources.
- **Risk:** Complexity in task card generation logic.
  - **Mitigation:** Start with simple patterns and incrementally increase complexity.

---

## Review Plan
- **Mid-Sprint Review (Week 1):**
  - Assess progress on the development environment and class definitions.
  - Address any blockers or delays.
- **End-of-Sprint Review (Week 2):**
  - Demonstrate the prototype and validate core game logic with test results.
  - Gather feedback for adjustments in Sprint 2.
