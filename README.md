# How to run GUI
## Setup:
- Import the files from this branch into your local machine and open it in any IDE to your liking (I use Eclipse btw).
## Run:
- If you successfully installed the files and opened it, navigate to src>application>Main.java, then run the file.
## Details:
### Main Class:
- The gameplay experience will execute starting from this class, it includes the application setups such as game title, screensize, etc.
### Controller Class:
- Handles events and scene switching
### application.css:
- Creates a few tweaks for the UI designs that can't be done in SceneBuilder
#### Creator note: 
- More features will be added later to improve user experience, such as backround music and return button.
- There will be more consistency to the screen background image and button dimensions, the current screen size is 1280x720 and will be standardized
- Transition between scenes will be worked upon
