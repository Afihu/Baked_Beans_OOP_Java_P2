# Development Plan for Ubongo Junior App - By Baked Beans

## Objectives
This document outlines the development plan for creating a Windows-based Ubongo Junior board game application. The project will be developed using Java with JavaFX for GUI,  with iterative delivery over 6 weeks.

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Core Game Functionality:** Implement the rules of the game, including board setup, tile placement, and timer-based gameplay.
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using JavaFX.
3. **User Interactivity:** Ensure smooth drag-and-drop functionality for placing tiles on the game board.
4. **Multiplayer Mode:** Implement both single-player (against a timer) and local multiplayer modes.
5. **Score Tracking:** Include a scoring mechanism to track player performance across multiple rounds.
6. **Instructions and Tutorial:** Provide an in-app tutorial to help new players understand the game.
7. **Testing and Debugging:** Ensure the app runs smoothly with no critical bugs.
8. **Packaging and Deployment:** Create an executable JAR file for easy installation and use on Windows.

## Agile Timeline
The project will be divided into 2-week sprints, with incremental deliverables reviewed and adjusted based on feedback.

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Project Setup and Core Gameplay Logic
- **Goals:**
  - Set up the development environment (Java, JavaFX, VS Code, Draw.io Integration extension on VS Code and Java Virtual Machine).
  - Define project structure and classes (e.g., `Game`, `Board`, `Tile`, `Player`).
  - Implement basic game rules, including board generation and tile placement logic.
  - Develop initial timer mechanism.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Initialized project repository.
  - Drafted UML diagram for classes.
  - Working prototype of the core game logic with basic tests.

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): GUI Implementation and Multiplayer
- **Goals:**
  - Build the main game screen with JavaFX.
  - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for tiles.
  - Add visual feedback for valid/invalid tile placement.
  - Develop local multiplayer functionality and scoring mechanism.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Interactive GUI with tile placement functionality.
  - Operational multiplayer mode with score tracking.

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Tutorial, Testing, and Deployment
- **Goals:**
  - Create an in-app tutorial for new users.
  - Refine the UI for aesthetics and usability.
  - Conduct comprehensive testing (unit and integration tests).
  - Fix identified bugs and package the application into an executable JAR file.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Completed tutorial and polished UI.
  - Bug-free application.
  - Deployable JAR file.

## Notes
- Sprint reviews will occur at the end of each sprint to assess progress and adapt plans as needed.
- Testing will be ongoing throughout development to ensure stability and usability.
- Additional features (e.g., online multiplayer, customizable boards) may be considered in future iterations, beyond the current 6-week scope.
