# How to run GUI
## Setup:
- Import the files from this branch into your local machine and open it in any IDE to your liking (I use Eclipse btw).
## Run:
- If you successfully installed the files and opened it, navigate to src>application>Main.java, then run the file.
### Creator note: 
More features will be added later to improve user experience, such as backround music and return button.
